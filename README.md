**PROJECT AIM & LOGIC**
Project created with the aim of exploring more JS features including features related to an audio file.

Not too many songs, but enough to show the buttons' functionalities, as a music player.

Assigning the same name to songs & img files has been the key, to let the system change song and picture as expected.
